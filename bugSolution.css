The solution involves understanding and adjusting the CSS selector order and specificity to ensure that the ID selector takes the correct precedence.

Here's the corrected CSS (`bugSolution.css`):

```css
#myElement {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass {
  color: red; /* This will not override the ID selector anymore */
}
.myContainer .myClass {
  color: green; /* This remains for more specific styling if needed */
}
```

By ensuring that the ID selector maintains higher precedence and handling specific cases correctly we prevent unexpected visual outcome.
